    <p>Acupuncture has been used for over 5000 years, apparently for pain relief and improved function.</p>
    <p>The Tyrolean Iceman, "Ötzi", is the well-preserved natural mummy of a man who lived about 5200 years ago during Copper Age Europeans. Ötzi had a total of 61 tattoos probably for pain relief treatments similar to acupressure or acupuncture. Although there is some evidence that China had acupuncture around then, this is at least 2,000 years before any proof of use in China, earlier then 1000 BCE. Amazingly, similar early tattoos have been found on mummies in Peru, Chile and Siberia! Photographs and drawings of this can be found at The Lancet Vol 354 September 18th 1999.</p>
